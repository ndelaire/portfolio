## Project Overview
The purpose behind this project was to create a responsive design for my portfolio. Although still in the beginning stages of creating my portfolio, I wanted to create the framework to add future projects and have it be accessible to a variety of different window and screen sizes. The code was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap CSS Framework to style and design the layout. I started off by having an About Me, a Contact page, and a Portfolio page.

## HTML
HTML was created for three separate files: index.html, contact.html, and portolio.html. For the index.html file, Bootstrap was used to create a navbar, I utilized the grid system to contain the About Me section and to add a fixed footer. 

The same was done for the contact.html and portfolio.html but with a few modifications. I used a Bootstrap form for the Contact Me container and Bootstrap Card Deck for the portfolio. These cards will be filled out at a later date as projects are added and then can be linked.
