## Project Overview
The purpose behind this project was to create a responsive design for my portfolio. Although still in the beginning stages of creating my portfolio, I wanted to create the framework to add future projects and have it be accessible to a variety of different window and screen sizes. The code was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap CSS Framework to style and design the layout. I started off by having an About Me, a Contact page, and a Portfolio page.
